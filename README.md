# Spotify Personal Streaming Project:
### Feel free to interact with the dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/christopher.dillard/viz/SpotifyDashboard_17114128195090/DBOverallSpotify) on my Tableau Public profile. There is also the option to listen to some of the songs featured on this dashboard with the embedded playlist :)

## In this project, I explored:
1. Streaming data from June 2016 to March 2024, needed to be requested from my account settings (took about a month to receive data files)
2. I joined the files for different years in Tableau and cleaned up data (nulls, odd variable names, etc.).
3. I saved photos of top 10 artists by downloading .png file from web
   - next, photos are cropped by saving them into a circle shape in MS Word.
   - these photos are them saved into the icons folder for tableau.
   - each top 10 artist photo and top 5 album cover reveals more data when hovered over.
4. Similarly, I downloaded the KPI symbols from icons8.com and saved them to KPI folder.
5. I embedded a playlist of the top 100 songs by streams that I created on my spotify account.
   - Spotify allows you to share it as a url, just need to change song order if you want a different background color.
6. I concatenated the song and artist names to create a new song variable, improving appearance and eliminating duplicates using a calculated field with a pipe symbol between them.
7. I then chose the right color palette for the dashboard.
8. Finally, I created a version of the dashboard that is optimized for mobile view.
